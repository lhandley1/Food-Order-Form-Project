# Food Order Form Project
## Summary
My sixth React Project assisted by Codeacademy as part of the Learn React course. The task was to create a food order form that stores the customer's name, phone number, address and order.

- State hooks were used to manage the state of each input within the form.
- Event handlers were used to update the states as the customer fills in their details.
- When the form is submitted the user is alerted of their order details.
